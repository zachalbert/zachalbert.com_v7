            I'm saying lots of words about things. Important words, the best words.
            I really do have all the best words. My words are so great they poop
            rainbows. They make me lattes. My words give good footrubs. These words
            are cooler than your words. They won't be told no. They take life seriously,
            but not too seriously, and by god â€” they have had. enough.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            I'm a digital product designer and entrepreneur, and I spend most of
            my time mentoring and developing designers. Iâ€™ve spent the last <span data-module="time-worked"></span> running the product design program at
            <a href="http://tradecraft.com/">Tradecraft</a>, and have trained over
            350 designers who now work all over the world in places like Google,
            Netflix, Tesla, Samsung and Facebook.
            <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/schools/tradecraft">We have good reviews</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to that, I worked for over 10 years as a consultant and first product designer / UX designer
            for many early stage startups, larger orgs like Target, and as a cofounder
            of <a href="https://foliotwist.com/">my own startup built to help fine artists</a>.
            I've done everything from graphic design, to 3D modeling, to product management,
            but I'm happiest when doing end-to-end design and hand coding prototypes
            alongside developers, researchers, and product managers.

          <h3>stuff</h3>
          <p>
            I train designers to be resilient, able to get work done, etc.
            I ask designers to pursue the same principles I pursue for myself, namely that designers should&hellip;
            <ul>
              <li>&hellip; work on things that should exist</li>
              <li>&hellip; look out for each other</li>
              <li>&hellip; be autodidacts</li>
              <li>&hellip; be aggressively curious</li>
              <li>&hellip; be resilient AF</li>
              <li>&hellip; be systems thinkers</li>
              <li>&hellip; be disciplined</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Why all the space stuff?</h3>
          <p>
            I have an unhealthy love for both CSS and the beauty of orbital motion.
            I make orreries like the one above, or
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cquQ29Glos">this one</a>, or
            <a href="/v6/index.html#top">this other one</a> to satiate my inner nerd.
          </p>
          <p>
            The orrery above uses real planetary data from nasa so their relative
            orbital motion is correct. However, I've taken artistic license with both
            the scale of the planets and their orbital distances.

            Pluto is included above because Iâ€™m not a savage who would revoke planethood once granted.
